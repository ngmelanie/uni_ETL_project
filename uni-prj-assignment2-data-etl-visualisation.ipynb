We can see that within the data set, the product with the lowest sales is 536 products sold. On the other hand, the highest number of products sold is 111,300. This shows that the values for Total Sold ranges from hundredths to hundred thousandths.\n\nBased on the **histogram**, we can see that most powerbanks listed on Shopee have more than 20,000mAh. Both 5000-10,000mAh, and 10,001-20,000mAh have almost the same amount and the least is 'No Size Stated'. 'No Size Stated' could mean that the sellers did not specifically list out the powerbanks' capacity size in Shopee's product specification.\n\nNext, based on the **boxplot** of Total Sold over the Powerbank Capacity Size, we can see that the category of 10,001-20,000mAh has the highest total number of sold compared to other categories. The category with the least number of sold products on Shopee is 5,000-10,000mAh. This tells us that people are more likely to buy powerbanks that have a capacity range from 10,001mAh to 20,000mAh.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n### **Did you see any outlier? Please explain.**\n**Answer:**\n\nThere are **outliers** in the boxplot for Powerbank Capacity Size categories, 5,000-10,000mAh and No Size Stated. For 5,000-10,000mAh there are 2 outliers. This shows that there are extreme values in the data that is not within the lower and upper fences. In the plotted boxplot, there are extreme outliers. They have a significant value compared to the rest. In this data, for example, there is a significant powerbank product listing that sold more than 60,000 items, compared to the rest from each specific listing link.\n\n\n\n---\n\n","metadata":{"id":"LP9NaNC7UjES"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ***B.

These negative correlations can mean that when Total Sold increases, the other decreases and vice versa. Which can indicate that within the dataset, not many people bought powerbanks with the brand Baseus. In contrast, Pineng and Total Sold have a correlation of 0.186857, which can mean Pineng is most likely to be bought. In addition, it is also shown in the scatterplot that Pineng is one of the highest sold among the other brands.\n\nBased on the **correlation function** between **Top Sold and the list of Powerbank Capacity Size (dummy variables)**, we can observe that there are negative correlation values, for example it is -0.182094 between Total Sold and 5,000-10,000mAh. These negative correlations can mean that when Total Sold increases, the other decreases and vice versa. These can indicate that not alot of people bought powerbanks that have the capacity range between 5,000-10,000mAh. In contrast, 10,001-20,000mAh and Total Sold have a correlation of 0.394530, which can mean that when the total of sales increases, the total number of people buying powerbank with a capacity size of 10,001-20,000mAh increases.\n\nBased on the **correlation function** between **Top Sold, Brand and Powerbank Capacity Size** from the dataframe, from the above output, we can only view Total Sold and it is 1.0. But we cannot view the output for Brand and Powerbank Capacity Size. This is because the other 2 attributes are categorical data.\n\nIn conclusion, we can assume that powerbanks with specifications of Pineng and 10,001-20,000mAh capacity size are popular among buyers in Shopee.\n\n---\n\n### **Did you see any outlier? Please explain.**\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, we can see that there are **outliers** based on the scatterplot. The extreme outliers are more prominent in Pineng and No Brand Stated. They have a significant value compared to the rest. In this data, for example, there is a significant powerbank product listing for brand Pineng that sold more than 100,000 items, compared to the other listings for brand Pineng which are 80,000 and below.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n","metadata":{"id":"gVBP-N6NU-XF"}}]}
